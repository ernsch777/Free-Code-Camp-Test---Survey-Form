1. Started the next test from Free-Code-Camp and have the survey form about half built. Pretty straightforward so far. 
2. Finished the html this morning after a long break and will handle CSS next. It was interesting doing all of the html first and getting used to it looking like crap without any CSS. 
3. Had to use Stackoverflow to discover the way to use default text in a drop down field.
